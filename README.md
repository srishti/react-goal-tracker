## Overview

This is a React application that lets a user track their goals. The application allows a user view existing goals, add a new goal to the list of existing goals and delete an existing goal when it's achieved.

Note that providing a goal name is mandatory before adding a goal (white spaces are not allowed) to the list of existing goals. If the user tries to do otherwise, the input box will turn into red color indicating that the user cannot proceed with the value typed inside the input box.

The application is responsive to devices of all screen sizes.
